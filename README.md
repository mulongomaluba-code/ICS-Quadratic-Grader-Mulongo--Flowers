# Quadratic Equation Solver & Grade Converter

A single-page **web application** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that allows users to:
1. Solve quadratic equations of the form **axÂ² + bx + c = 0**
2. Convert numeric scores (0â€“100) into letter grades

All calculations are performed **client-side**, with no data sent to any server.

## ðŸ“˜ Features

### ðŸ§® Quadratic Equation Solver
- Accepts coefficients **a**, **b**, and **c**
- Validates that **a â‰  0**
- Computes:
  - **Discriminant (D)** = bÂ² - 4ac  
  - **Roots** using the quadratic formula:  
    x = (-b Â± âˆšD) / (2a)
- Displays:
  - Equation in standard form
  - Value of the discriminant
  - Nature of the roots (real/complex)
  - Computed roots (up to 4 decimal places)
- Handles:
  - Two distinct real roots (D > 0)
  - One repeated real root (D = 0)
  - Two complex conjugate roots (D < 0)

### ðŸŽ“ Grade Converter
- Accepts a **score between 0 and 100**
- Converts the score into a **letter grade** based on the following scale:

| Score Range | Grade |
|--------------|--------|
| 85â€“100       | A+     |
| 75â€“84        | A      |
| 65â€“74        | B+     |
| 60â€“64        | B      |
| 55â€“59        | C+     |
| 50â€“54        | C      |
| 0â€“49         | D      |

- Displays the result in a color-coded box:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green for excellent results (A+)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow for average results
  - ðŸ”´ Red for failing results (D)
